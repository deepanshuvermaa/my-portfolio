A drag-and-drop website generator designed for Go2Billing SaaS customers. Users can select from pre-built sections and templates, arrange them visually, and export a fully functional, ready-to-deploy website without writing any code. Empowers non-technical users to create professional web presences in minutes, reducing the barrier to entry for small businesses looking to establish an online presence alongside their billing software.
